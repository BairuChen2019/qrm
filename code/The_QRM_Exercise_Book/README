R scripts of "The QRM Exercise Book"

As for all other code provided on qrmtutorial.org, in case some code does not run
for you, please make sure you have the very latest versions of the involved R packages
installed from their corresponding development server (typically R-Forge). For example:
install.packages("qrmtools", repos = "http://R-Forge.R-project.org")

Cheers,
